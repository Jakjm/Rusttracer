# Rusttracer
This is a command line program written in Rust that uses software rendering to produce
a highly realistic image of a 3D scene.
First, it reads a description of the scene to be rendered from a file.
Next, it calculates the colour of each pixel from the perspective of the point of an 
eye, located at the origin (0,0,0), that is looking towards the negative Z axis.
Finally, these colours are processed and written into .png and .ppm image files.

You can compile the program using Cargo: 

    cargo build --release

To run the program after compiling, you can run the following:

    cargo run --release input-file 

Where input-file is a file that describes the 3D scene for the program to render into .ppm and .png files. The specification for scene description files is as follows:

Every description file contains each of the following lines exactly once, however they may be ordered arbitrarily: 

	NEAR n
	LEFT l
	RIGHT r
	BOTTOM b
	TOP t
    RES w h
	BACK bR bG bB
    AMBIENT aR aG aB
	OUTPUT <output filename>

Where *n* is positive, *l* < *r* and *b* < *t*.
The viewing window is the rectangle whose top left corner is (*l*,*t*,*-n*) and whose bottom right corner is (*r*,*b*,*-n*).
The viewing window is divided into *w* columns and *h* rows,
where *w* and *h* are integers.
The output image of width *w* and height *h* is generated by tracing a ray from the origin through each column of each row.
If the ray does not collide with any shape, the pixel has colour (*bR*,*bG*,*bB*) where *bR*, *bG* and *bB* are between 0 and 1 and represent the red, green and blue background colour respectively
